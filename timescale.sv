In Verilog/SystemVerilog, time_precision is the smallest time resolution that the simulator can represent.
It defines how finely simulation time is measured and how fractional delays are rounded or truncated.

1. Syntax of timescale
`timescale <time_unit>/<time_precision>


time_unit → unit for delay values (e.g., 1ns, 10ps, 100ps)

time_precision → smallest step the simulator uses to represent time

2. Example
`timescale 1ns/1ps


time_unit = 1ns → #1 means 1ns.

time_precision = 1ps → simulator steps in 1ps resolution.

If you write:

#0.5


→ This equals 0.5 ns → 500 ps.

3. Why time_precision is Important
Purpose	Explanation / Use Case
Simulation Resolution	Determines how accurately time events are scheduled.
Fractional Delays	Controls rounding of delays when delay is smaller than precision.
Consistent Multi-Module Timing	When different modules have different precisions, simulator aligns everything to the smallest precision globally.
High-Speed Designs	Useful for GHz clocks or high-speed interfaces where sub-ns accuracy is required.
4. Rounding Behavior

Delays are rounded to the nearest multiple of time_precision.

Example:
`timescale 1ns/100ps


time_unit = 1ns

time_precision = 100ps

Delay Written	Actual Simulation Delay
#0.25 ns	Rounded to #0.2 ns (200 ps)
#0.27 ns	Rounded to #0.3 ns (300 ps)
5. Multi-Module Precision Normalization

If you have multiple modules with different precisions, the simulator converts all timing to the smallest precision.

Example:

// Module A
`timescale 1ns/1ps
// Module B
`timescale 1ns/100ps


Global smallest precision = 1ps.

Both modules' delays are internally calculated at 1ps resolution for accuracy.

6. Real-Life Use Case

High-Speed Clock Generation

`timescale 1ns/1ps
module clk_gen;
  logic clk = 0;
  always #0.625 clk = ~clk;  // 800 MHz clock (period = 1.25 ns)
endmodule


Without 1ps precision, fractional delay 0.625ns might be truncated or rounded incorrectly, leading to jitter or wrong clock frequency in simulation.

Key Takeaways

time_precision = simulation accuracy.

Ensures proper modeling for fractional delays or high-speed timing.

The smaller the precision, the more accurate (but potentially slower) the simulation.
